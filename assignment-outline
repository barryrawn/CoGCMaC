#assignment sketch

Example near start:
-model differential equation of RL circuit
-wrap a control around

(try step, transfer function)

Example near end:

time series: steps and ramps
parametesr: use your student number
show output at circuit


Wek 1: single ; laplacian; do rom stcrathc
introduce average model

WEek 2: give them DC machine circuit

Week 3: assignment: do park transformation

Week 4: indicative:  doubly fed

Week 5: now turn in

Wek 7 a governor


Week 9 AVR with VSC

Week 10: vsc with cosphi regulation

Week 11: LV ride through

Actual study:

formulae: submit written, submit simulink models

outcome: models of these units
